# 🧠 cpp-labyrinth  
**Exploring the Depths of C++ — from Memory to Machines, APIs, and Blockchains**

---

## 🌌 Overview  
This repository is my personal exploration lab for **C++** — a journey through how computers think, store, and communicate.  
Here I experiment with:  
- Low-level **memory manipulation** and hardware interaction  
- Building **CLI tools** and **system-level programs**  
- Connecting to **APIs and web services**  
- Implementing **cryptography and blockchain integrations**

The goal isn’t just to write code — it’s to understand how software meets silicon and how logic becomes life in a machine.

## 🧩 Structure  
Each folder covers a different learning layer:  

| Folder | Focus |
|--------|--------|
| `basics/` | C++ syntax, data types, loops, and functions |
| `memory/` | Pointers, references, stack vs heap, and memory optimization |
| `system/` | File I/O, threading, and OS-level operations |
| `network/` | Working with APIs, sockets, and HTTP requests |
| `crypto/` | Hashing, encryption, and blockchain communication |
| `projects/` | Mini projects combining all the above |

---

## 🛠 Setup  

### Requirements  
- **C++17+ compiler** (MinGW-w64, MSYS2, or Clang)  
- **VS Code** (recommended) with the **C/C++ extension**  
- **Git** for version control  

### Build & Run  
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
````

For more complex builds, a `Makefile` or CMake configuration will be added later.

## 📚 Learning Path

Follow this progression if you’re new to C++:

1. `basics/` → Learn syntax, control flow, and types.
2. `memory/` → Understand how memory works and why it matters.
3. `system/` → Learn how software talks to hardware.
4. `network/` → Communicate with the web and external APIs.
5. `crypto/` → Explore security, encryption, and blockchain fundamentals.

Each stage includes notes and commented examples.

## ⚡ Vision

To master C++ not just as a programming language, but as a **philosophy of control** — control over logic, memory, and digital reality.
This repo evolves as I learn, fail, and uncover new layers of what makes computers tick.

## 🤝 Contribute

If you stumble upon this and want to add something — from memory tricks to blockchain experiments — fork the repo and open a PR.
Learning is better when shared.
